Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures.
The structural design patterns simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships.


Adapting an interface into another according to client expectation.
An Adapter Pattern says that just "converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client wants".
The Adapter Pattern is also known as Wrapper.
A class adapter uses multiple inheritance to adapt one interface to another.


There are the following specifications for the adapter pattern:

Target Interface: This is the desired interface class which will be used by the clients.
Adapter class: This class is a wrapper class which implements the desired target interface and modifies the specific request available from the Adaptee class.
Adaptee class: This is the class which is used by the Adapter class to reuse the existing functionality and modify them for desired use.
Client: This class will interact with the Adapter class.


Suppose you have a Bird class with fly() , and chirp()methods. 
And also a Duck class with squeak() method. 
Let’s assume that you are short on Duck objects and you would like to use Bird objects in their place. 
Birds have some similar functionality but implement a different interface, so we can’t use them directly. 
So we will use adapter pattern. Here our client would be Duck and adaptee would be Bird.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Bird{
    
    public:
    
    virtual void fly()=0;
    virtual void chirp()=0;
    
};

class Sparrow: public Bird{
    
    public:
    
    void fly()
    {
        cout<<"Flying\n";
    }
    
    void chirp()
    {
        cout<<"Chirping\n";
    }
    
};


class Duck{
    
    public:
    
    virtual void squeak()=0;
    
};

class ToyDuck: public Duck{
    
    public:
    
    void squeak()
    {
        cout<<"Squeak\n";
    }
    
};


//Now u are short of toyducks and want to use bird class as a toyducks

class BirdAdapter: public Duck{
    
    Bird* bird;
    
    public:
    
    BirdAdapter(Bird* bird)
    {
        this->bird=bird;
    }
    
    void squeak()
    {
        bird->chirp();
    }
    
};

int main()
{
    Bird* sparrow=new Sparrow();
    sparrow->chirp();
    
    Duck* duck=new ToyDuck();
    duck->squeak();
    
    Duck* newDuck=new BirdAdapter(sparrow);
    newDuck->squeak();

    return 0;
}

Output:

Chirping
Squeak
Chirping

Eg-> The user wants to draw a rectangle passing x,y,width and height but we have a legacy class that expects coords (x1,y1,x2,y2) we need to convert this 
legacy class into a class as per user requirements.
